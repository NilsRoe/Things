Circle Cutting Jig for Plunge Router
====================================

Description
-----------

This was designed for a project where I need to cut loads of holes out of wood with a plunge router.

The idea is it hooks into 2 pieces of m8 threaded rod, which fit into the guide holes in the router, and is screwed to the center hole of the circle you want to cut.  The router is then held the correct distance away, and cuts a nice perfectly round circle.

Instructions
------------

0. You may need to adjust the parameters and re-render the scad file before printing, the attached STL is for my router, which has 8mm holes that are 84mm apart.
1. Print
2. Fix a 608 bearing in the central bearing hole using m3 or m4 bolts, and fit the central piece through the middle of it.
3. Attach two pieces of M8 threaded rod through the 8mm Holes, and bolt on both sides.
4. Insert the threaded rod into the guide holes in the router. the distance between the central hole and the inside of the router bit is the radius of your hole.
5. Put a screw through the central piece and into the center point of the piece you are cutting, and cut!
