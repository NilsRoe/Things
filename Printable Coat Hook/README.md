Description
===========

Most coat hooks I could find on thingiverse were a bit weak for hanging a coat from, and not really designed with the strengths and weaknesses of FDM printing in mind.

I designed this one to be short, squat, and strong, so it is cheap to print but should last forever. 

Instructions
============

1. Print
2. Fix to wall using 4mm - 5mm screws
3. Hang coat 

Tools
=====
* RepRap or similar 3D Printer
