Things
======

These are my models and designs for physical things you can make!

Why GitHub?
===========

My models used to all be on thingiverse, but in September 2012 the thingiverse ToS were changed to include:

"You agree to irrevocably waive (and cause to be waived) any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to your User Content."

Which is incompatible with the CC-by-SA license all my things are licensed under.
